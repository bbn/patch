# Logger Abstraction Refactoring

## Changes Made

1. Created a new central logging utility at `/lib/logger.ts` with the following functions:
   - `logError(context: string, message: string, error?: any)` - For logging errors
   - `logInfo(context: string, message: string)` - For informational logs
   - `logWarning(context: string, message: string)` - For warnings
   - `logDebug(context: string, message: string, data?: any)` - For debug info (only in development)

2. Updated key files to use the new logging abstraction:
   - `/app/api/gears/[gearId]/chat/route.ts` - All console statements replaced with new logger
   - `/components/GearTester.tsx` - All console statements replaced with new logger
   - `/lib/models/gear/Gear.ts` - Partially updated with the new logger

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All log messages now follow a standard format with context
2. **Filtering**: The context parameter makes it easier to filter logs by component
3. **Development Mode**: Debug logs only appear in development, reducing noise in production
4. **Better Error Handling**: Separate functions for different log levels
5. **Future Extensibility**: The logger can be extended to send logs to monitoring services

## Files Still Needing Updates

Many files still contain direct console.log statements:

1. Remaining parts of `/lib/models/gear/Gear.ts`
2. All files in `/lib/models/patch/`
3. Other model files and utility files
4. API route handlers
5. Component files

## Next Steps

1. Continue replacing console statements in other files
2. Consider adding log levels for more fine-grained control
3. Add option to send critical logs to a monitoring service
4. Add timing information for performance debugging
