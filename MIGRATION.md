# Migration Plan for Modular Structure

This document outlines the step-by-step process to migrate from the current monolithic model structure to the new modular one. The goal is to minimize disruption while improving maintainability.

## Overview of Changes

We've refactored the large `Gear.ts` and `Patch.ts` files into smaller, more focused modules:

### Gear Module Structure
- `lib/models/gear/types.ts` - Interface definitions
- `lib/models/gear/Gear.ts` - Core Gear class
- `lib/models/gear/processing.ts` - LLM processing functionality
- `lib/models/gear/connections.ts` - Connection management
- `lib/models/gear/examples.ts` - Example inputs management
- `lib/models/gear/index.ts` - Public exports

### Patch Module Structure
- `lib/models/patch/types.ts` - Interface definitions
- `lib/models/patch/Patch.ts` - Core Patch class
- `lib/models/patch/nodes.ts` - Node management
- `lib/models/patch/edges.ts` - Edge management
- `lib/models/patch/reactflow.ts` - ReactFlow integration
- `lib/models/patch/utils.ts` - Static utilities
- `lib/models/patch/index.ts` - Public exports

## Migration Approach

### Phase 1: Prepare for Migration
1. Create the new directory structure (completed)
2. Implement the new modular files (completed)
3. Create the index.ts files for proper exports (completed)

### Phase 2: Gradual Migration
1. Create new module index.ts to export all components from the new structure
2. Keep the original Gear.ts and Patch.ts files temporarily as pass-through modules
3. Update the original files to re-export from the new modules
4. Verify application functionality with the redirected imports

### Phase 3: Update Import References
1. Identify all import references to the original files
2. Update imports to use the new modular structure:
   - Change `import { Gear, ... } from '../models/Gear'` to `import { Gear, ... } from '../models/gear'`
   - Change `import { Patch, ... } from '../models/Patch'` to `import { Patch, ... } from '../models/patch'`
3. Test each component after updating imports

### Phase 4: Cleanup
1. Once all imports are updated, remove the original Gear.ts and Patch.ts files
2. Run comprehensive tests to ensure all functionality works properly
3. Update documentation to reflect the new structure

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each file has a clear, single responsibility
2. **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together
3. **Reduced File Size**: Smaller files are easier to understand and navigate
4. **Code Reuse**: Utility functions are properly separated for reuse
5. **Testing**: Smaller modules make unit testing easier

## Testing Strategy

1. Create unit tests for each module to ensure core functionality
2. Implement integration tests for interactions between modules
3. Perform end-to-end tests of the application to verify overall functionality
4. Use TypeScript to catch any type errors during compilation
